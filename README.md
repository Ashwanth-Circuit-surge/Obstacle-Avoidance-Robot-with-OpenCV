Obstacle Avoidance Robot
This project showcases an obstacle avoidance robot developed using Arduino Nano, ESP12F, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, L298N Motor Driver, DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player, and 74HC595 Shift Register. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles in its path.

Overview
The robot utilizes an Arduino Nano microcontroller board as its main control unit, coordinating the functionality of various sensors and actuators to achieve obstacle avoidance. An ESP12F module is employed for WiFi connectivity, enabling remote control and monitoring of the robot's operation. Additionally, a HC-05 Bluetooth module allows for direct communication with the robot via a smartphone or computer.

Components
Arduino Nano: Acts as the brain of the robot, executing control algorithms and interfacing with peripheral devices.
ESP12F: Provides WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring and control of the robot.
HC-05 Bluetooth Module: Enables wireless communication with the robot for manual control and command input.
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles in the robot's path by emitting ultrasonic pulses and measuring the time taken for the echo to return.
L298N Motor Driver: Controls the speed and direction of the robot's motors, facilitating movement and navigation.
DFPlayer Mini MP3 Player: Produces sound effects and alerts to provide feedback during operation.
74HC595 Shift Register: Expands the number of output pins available to the Arduino, allowing for control of additional peripherals such as LEDs.
Procedure
Initialization: The Arduino initializes the required libraries and establishes communication with peripheral devices, including the ultrasonic sensor, motor driver, Bluetooth module, and MP3 player.

Connection Setup: The WiFi module connects to an available network, enabling remote monitoring and control via a web interface.

Bluetooth Communication: The robot waits for incoming commands from a connected Bluetooth device. Commands include moving forward, backward, turning right, stopping, and playing sound effects.

Obstacle Detection: Using the ultrasonic sensor, the robot continuously scans its surroundings for obstacles. If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range, the robot initiates evasive maneuvers to avoid collision.

Motor Control: Based on the received commands and obstacle detection data, the Arduino adjusts the speed and direction of the motors to navigate the robot safely through its environment.

Feedback and Alerts: The robot provides feedback to the user through visual and auditory cues, such as LED indicators and sound effects generated by the MP3 player.

Functions
moveForward(): Initiates forward movement of the robot by setting the motor speeds and directions accordingly.
moveBackward(): Initiates backward movement of the robot.
turnRight(): Initiates a right turn.
stopRobot(): Halts the robot's movement.
playSound(): Triggers the playback of sound effects via the MP3 player.
setLed(bool state): Controls the state of LED indicators using the shift register.
Developer
Developed By Ashwanth, this project represents a culmination of efforts to create an efficient and versatile obstacle avoidance robot capable of operating in various environments.
